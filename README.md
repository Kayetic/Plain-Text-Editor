# Welcome to Plain Text Editor ðŸ‘‹

This is a _very_ simple mac app that let's you edit text, that is it. It is a very simple app that I made to learn how to make mac apps. It is probably not meant to be used as a daily driver, but if you want to, go ahead.

## Install

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Kayetic/Plain-Text-Editor/releases), unzip it and place the .app file in your Applications folder.
